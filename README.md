# Distributed Execution Framework (DEF)

The Distributed Execution Framework (DEF) has been developed at the University of Applied Sciences Vorarlberg (https://www.fhv.at) within the scope of the EnFiLo project: https://www.fhv.at/en/research/energy/josef-ressel-centre-for-applied-scientific-computing/

The idea behind the DEF was that analysts, who are working in the domains of energy, finance and logistics, are developing algorithms for their specific domain. From these algorithms at least parts could be reused in the other domains. This means, on the one hand, that a library with routines which represent reusable parts of computationally complex algorithms, had to be developed and on the other hand, a system for executing these computationally intensive problems is necessary. 

For that purpose the DEF has been developed, which supports parallel execution of library routines, independent of programming languages and runtime environments.

The main benefits that arise from using the DEF are:
* high performance through parallelization of code execution
* high efficiency, because all available resources are utilized
* high flexibility for the application programmes, because the library routines can be integrated into their applications, independent of the programming languages used
* high scalability because of the usage of Cloud Computing

**The DEF is still under development**, as well as this description and the documentation, which can be found here: https://def-documentation.readthedocs.io/
